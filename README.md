# Hospital Management System (HMS)

The **Hospital Management System (HMS)** is a comprehensive application built with **Angular** (Frontend) and **JSON** (Database) to facilitate efficient hospital operations through a robust role-based access control system. Designed with a streamlined and intuitive interface, the application enables secure, well-organized access for each user role, promoting enhanced patient care and operational efficiency.

A merchandise management system utilizing Spring Boot, Angular, and MySQL is designed to handle various aspects of clothing production. It involves the creation of different clothing materials and TechPacks, aligning with the designer's specifications. Customers place orders for specific materials, indicating size and quantity requirements. Subsequently, a Bill of Material (BOM) is generated, detailing the cost of each material by size and labor. Raw materials are procured based on production needs. The system offers a comprehensive view of the business process, displaying order, sales, and revenue data on the dashboard alongside tables for order, procurement, and inventory management.
